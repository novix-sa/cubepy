# About Cubepy

**Cubepy** is a Python package intended for operations with multidimensional labeled arrays.

that aims to bring the labeled data power of  [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)  to the physical sciences, by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for analytics on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data for which pandas excels. Our approach adopts the  [Common Data Model](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/CDM)  for self- describing scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences:`xarray.Dataset`  is an in-memory representation of a netCDF file.library intended for opera
